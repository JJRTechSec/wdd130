      <img src="./images/profile.webp" alt="Hi! My name is Joseph Jameson-Rickard" width="200">
      <p class="intro">I am Joseph, I'm 26 years old and come from the UK, but currently live in Norway. I love traveling with my wife, sports, sleeping and eating. I love running, and I am currently working towards getting my marathon time down as low as possible. I received a BSc in Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation, but unfortunately that degree is not recognised here in Norway, and so I have had to find another career path that will be valid wherever I go. I had some friends and clients who knew programming, and so I started trialing web development before I finsihed my degree, and I discovered that I love it even more than my initial degree.</p>

        Norway is known for vikings, snow, the northern lights, mountains and the fjords. During the summer the sun never sets (in certain parts of the country), and during the winter it never rises (up north).
