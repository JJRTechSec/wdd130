      <p>I am Joseph, I'm 26 years old and come from the UK, but currently live in Norway. I love traveling with my wife, sports, sleeping and eating. I love running, and I am currently working towards getting my marathon time down as low as possible.</p>

      <p>
        Norway is known for vikings, snow, the northern lights, mountains and the fjords. During the summer the sun never sets (in certain parts of the country), and during the winter it never rises (up north).
